# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.  

## Installation
Install project:
`npm install`

Run project: 
`npm run dev`

## Review updates

Implemented:
- Implementation of `useRef()` for input field
- Import `FormEvent`
- Consequent usage of function types. Previously the app file has a class funtion type, while the component files had arrow functions. I have decided to use arrow functions in all files, and I have implemented an arrow function inside the app file.

To discuss:
- Check correct funtion names.
- Import props in a different way.
- Wrap components in HTML section tags.

New functionalities:
- Implemented: An item delete option.
- On going: implement item update functionality, and discussing the best approach.
- Possibly implementing a sort functionality, in which we can move items up and down.
